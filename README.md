# Professional NgRx

After cloning the project, run `yarn` for downloading the dependencies. Verify
that the applications starts with `npm run start`.

`https://api.eternal-holidays.net` acts as the default backend.

---

If the backend is not reachable you can also run the backend locally (see below)
.

### Local Backend

You can run the backend also locally. It is written in Spring Boot and uses H2
as database. The db file is located in `backend/db.mv.db`.

Execute `./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl backend`. You require at least Java 1.8.

You also have to replace the `baseUrl` property in `environment.ts` or just
run `npm run start:dev-local`.

### Full Rewrite from Scratch

If you have the desire to fully rebuild the system from scratch with an Angular
application build from scratch, following commands should be executed:

```bash
npx ng add @angular/material

# NgRx
yarn add @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools

# Forms
yarn add @ngx-formly/core @ngx-formly/material ngx-formly-helpers

# Utility libs
yarn add date-fns

# Tailwind
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# RxJs Marbles
yarn add -D rxjs-marbles

# Testing Boilerplate
yarn add -D @ngneat/spectator ng-mocks @testing-library/angular


# Playwright
yarn add -D @playwright/test
```
