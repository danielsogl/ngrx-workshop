# Webinar NgRx - Best Practices: 28. March 2022

This is the repository which was used at the Webinar for NgRx best practices.

It shows best practices for 
1. error handling,
2. deferred action, and
3. dependent feature states.

Please note we didn't include architectural best practices. In practice (or as shown in our "Professional NgRx" workshop), dependency rules would be in place which require a different structure. 

Slides are located in `/slides.pdf`.
